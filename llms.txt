## Compliance with EU Regulations

Starting December 8, 2023, wines produced for sale in the EU must display nutritional values and ingredient lists. e-label.eu facilitates compliance by allowing wineries to present this information digitally through QR codes on their bottles. This method meets the requirements set forth in Regulation (EU) 2021/2117.
